# Alzheimers-Disease-Classification
This project presents a custom deep convolutional neural network model for multi-class Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) classification. The evaluation of the model was done using K-fold cross-validation. Our model is capable of classifying image samples from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset into five classes (Control Normal, Early Mild Cognitive Impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Late Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer’s Disease) with an accuracy of 91.72%, which outperforms the existing work done till now.
